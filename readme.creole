= Sublime Terminal

A Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2) plugin that provides a key-bindings and menu entries for launching a terminal at a given file or folder.

== Installation

Simply clone the repository into a new "Terminal" folder in the Sublime Text 2 Packages directory on your machine. The Packages directory can be found via the "Preferences > Browse Packages..." menu entry.

== Usage

Sublime Terminal can perform two things:

* Launch terminal in folder containing current file
* Launch terminal in the project folder containing current file

The project folder is the folder that was added to the project that contains the file.

For instance, if {{{/home/will/wbond.net}}} was added to the current project via //Project > Add Folder to Projectâ€¦// and ctrl+shift+t was pressed while editing {{{/home/will/wbond.net/css/main.css}}}, then a terminal would be opened at {{{/home/will/wbond.net/css/}}}. If ctrl+shift+alt+t was pressed while editing the same file, it would open at {{{/home/will/wbond.net}}} since that was the folder added to the project.

=== Key Bindings

* Current file terminal: ctrl+shift+t (Windows, Linux) or cmd+shift+t (OS X)
* Project folder terminal: ctrl+shift+alt+t (Windows, Linux) or cmd+shift+alt+t (OS X)

Key bindings can be customized by accessing the //Preferences > Package Preferences > Terminal Key Bindings// menu.

=== Context Menus

There are context menu entries in the editor view and the sidebar for opening a terminal at any of those locations.

=== Terminal Command

By default, Sublime Terminal will open the standard terminal for the current operating system:

* Windows: Powershell, or cmd
* OS X: Terminal
* Linux: gnome-terminal (Gnome), konsole (KDE), xfce4-terminal (XFCE), xterm

A custom terminal command can be used by accessing the //Preferences > Package Preferences > Terminal Settings// menu.
